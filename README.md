# Bioinformatic Algorithms

Those are some of the programs I wrote while studying bioinformatics.
They were really usefull to put what I know about genetics, statistics,
algorithms, data structures and programming (C++, Rust and Python) into
practice.

I am a computer engineering student and I used the following resources to learn
bioinformatics:

*   [Einf√ºhrung in die Bioinformatik][Bioinf_RWTH], WS of 2014 at the [RWTH Aachen University][RWTH];
*   [Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1)][B1_Coursera] at [Coursera][];
*   [Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 2)][B2_Coursera] at [Coursera][];
*   [Rosalind][];
*   Books:
    *   [Bioinformatics Algorithms: an Active Learning Approach][Compeau]
    *   [Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids][Durbin]

My [Rosalind Repository][Rosalind_repo] is private, because the [Rosalind][]
team [forbids](http://rosalind.info/faq/#can-i-post-my-solutions-somewhere) the
publication of code outside of the [Rosalind][] website to avoid plagiarism.
